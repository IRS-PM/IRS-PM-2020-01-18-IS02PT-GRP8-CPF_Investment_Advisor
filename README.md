## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
Life expectancies over the world has generally increased over the years, allowing us to be able to spend more time with loved ones and enjoy various activities. Most importantly, there are more years to enjoy after retirement. To ensure the desired standard of living during our golden years, a significant retirement nest egg has to be maintained. 

Though the Singapore government has implemented a compulsory social security savings scheme for every working Singapore Citizen and Permanent Resident, it would be good to further boost our retirement nest by investing.
However, all investment comes with risk and various important decisions that have to be made. We have to be careful to ensure that our retirement savings are not overwhelmingly at risk while maximizing our expected returns. 

In this project, our group has proposed a solution, named CPF Investment Advisor. CPF Investment Advisor is able to address the various concerns that one may have before investing â€“ should I invest, or should I just leave the money in my CPF account? How much should I invest in each stock? We will also discuss limitations of the solution and suggest possible improvements for future work to handle investment products of increased complexity.
